# IO FACTORY REACT BOILERPLATE

## Getting started
Take a back seat! We have got you covered to kickstart your react project, use `npm start` for the dev server and `npm run build` for distribution.

## Testing
In order for a successful deployment all tests must pass. Please refer to package.json in the `scripts` section under `"test"` to understand what tests will be run.
- run end-to-end tests (headless front-end) on unix-based: `npm run e2e`
- run unit tests on unix-based: `npm run test`

### Development Server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. The documentations will be available at `/jsdoc`.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Build Documentation
Run `npm run build:docs` to build the project documentation. The build artifacts will be stored in the `docs/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [jest](https://jestjs.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [cypress](https://www.cypress.io).
